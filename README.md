# simply-reflux
Simplest way to understand react + flux using [reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs)  implementation. I try to keep it clean with fewest modules as possible. The application itself does only one simple thing to update a counter with a single button. Though the underlaying structure of this manifest the reflux architecture of unidirectional dataflow.

Update 1: added few sample pages routing and 404 page.<br/>
Update 2: added firebase test.<br/>
Update 3: bundle with webpack, added hot reload.<br/>
Update 4: added eslint checking.<br/>
Update 5: use express server with HTML5 Push State to support react-router history location.
