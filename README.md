# simply-reflux
Simplest way to understand react + flux using [reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs)  implementation. I try to keep it clean with fewest modules as possible. The application itself does only one simple thing to update a counter with a single button. Though the underlaying structure of this manifest the reflux architecture of unidirectional dataflow.

#installation

``
BrowserSync up and start hacking with live reload.
